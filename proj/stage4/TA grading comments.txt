This problem has a high level of complexity given that is related to the topic of anomaly detection. The document does not mention the challenges of doing this project. For example, is a dataset available or you need to collect the data?, are current ML models suitable for this type of problem, or you will need to modify any existing method?

The initial problem changed from an anomaly detection problem to a sentiment analysis problem. The document does not mention the challenges of doing this project. The document needs to elaborate better on the goals of the project. It mentions that the project is related to sentiment analysis and classification. However, sentiment analysis is a classification task (positive/negative/neutral). Moreover, finding if a sentiment of a review matches the rating of a given item, it is a trivial task. As a comment, there are no ratings for the reviews, the ratings are for the items. In any case, the reviews have a helpfulness score, but this is another research direction. The algorithms mentioned are not sentiment analysis algorithms; they are classification algorithms. TF-IDF is not even a classifier. Moreover, there is no explanation in the document of why these algorithms are selected. Are these the most used ones? Are there better algorithms for this task? The bag-of-words representation is the best technique for this problem? What about other techniques that consider the text semantics and word order?
